## Installation  

### Clone the repository :

```
git clone https://github.com/graiess073029/login-system-api
cd api2
```

### Install dependencies :

```
npm install
```

### Virtual environment configuration : 

1.  Create a  `.env`  file in the root directory with the following variables:

```python
# Database Configuration
USERNAME = your_db_username
PASSWORD = your_db_password
DB = your_database_name
HOST = your_database_host
PORT = your_database_port
ACCOUNTS_TABLE_NAME = your_database_accounts_tableName
RESET_TOKEN_TABLE_NAME = your_resetTokens_tableName

# Origins accepted by the server
ORIGIN = *

# JWT Configuration
# The logout key is a key that the server must get in the logout proccess to approve it. Otherwise, it'll responsd with an error
SECRETKEY = your_jwt_secret
LOGOUT_KEY = your_logout_key 

# SMTP Configuration
SMTP_Server = smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT = your_smtp_port
EMAIL = your_email
PASS = your_email_password

# Server Configuration
SERVERPORT = your_server_port

```


## Running the API

### Development Mode : 

```
npm run dev
```

### Production Mode : 

```
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Testing : 

Run the test suite:

```
npm run test
```

## Integration
It is very simple to integrate this api in your apps and services:
    1. Make sure the api is running seperately from your main app (they don't share the same port or processes...)
    2. Making **GET** or **POST** requests to the api and direct the user basing on the api response :  
- **Exemple** :
to know if a user is logged in and has a valid account, you need to fetch **GET /account/auth/** and basing on the response you build your app.  
  - **Response exemple** : you redirect the user to the login page
```json
{
    "state" : "redirection",
    "link" : "/account/login",
    "message" : "unauthorized user",
    "statusCode" : 401
}
```

  - **Response exemple** : you let the user use your app 
```json
{
    "state" : "success",
    "link" : "",
    "message" : "authorized user",
    "statusCode" : 200
}
```

### Error Handling

When an error occurs, the error is logged in the console and saved in a file "error.log". For security reasons, the error message or description is not shown in the response : 

```json
{
    "state": "error",
    "message": "An internal server error has occured !",
    "statusCode": 500
}
```

### Security Considerations

1.  Password Requirements:
    
    -   Minimum 8 characters
    -   At least one uppercase letter
    -   At least one lowercase letter
    -   At least one number
    -   At least one special character
    
2.  Rate Limiting:
    
    -   Login attempts: 5 per 15 minutes
    -   Password reset requests: 1 per day
3.  Session Security:
    
    -   HTTP-only cookies
    -   Secure in production
    -   24-hour expiration
    -   Same-site policy
